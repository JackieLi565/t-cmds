# t-cmds

A little terminal application to store those very long commands that you just can't remember.
Wanted to get familiar with [Bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) but got bored of building todo lists.

## What It Do?

- Persist cmds
- Add cmds
- Delete cmds
- Copy cmd to clipboard
- Terminal UI looks cool.
